Implement a clock which takes as its input two integer values, one for “hours” and one for “minutes”, and returns the time as it would appear on a 24 hour clock.

Example: “hours”=13, “minutes”=12, clock = 13:12

Your clock should accept any integer input value, including negative integers.

Example: “hours”=-8, “minutes”=0, clock = 16:00 

Your clock must be able to work with “minutes” inputs great than 60.

Example: “hours”=0, “minutes”=90, clock = 01:30

Your programme should also allow the user to add and subtract minutes from the time on a given clock. 

Example: “hours”=12 “minutes”=15, “add_minutes”=30, clock = 12:45

Finally, your programme must be able to compare two clocks and return TRUE if they represent the same time on a 24 hour clock.
